### What did you do this past week? ###

This past week was pretty low intensity. I read the
"Liskov Subsitution Principle" paper which explains the significance of
understanding the contracts that your interfaces impose. For example, a square
*is not* a rectangle because the contract for a square's `SetWidth` function
is different than the contract for a rectangle's `SetWidth` function.

As well, we got our
first glimpses of the final semester project, so I created a Slack
group for our team to start communicating over. I also created a when2meet so
that my team could better understand what times we are available to work
together. In group programming projects, I find that it's very important for
team members to work together as closely and as often as possible.

### What will you do next week? ###

My team and I are going to start laying out the foundation for how we want to
develop. It sounds like we will be doing a hybrid Scrum-XP development
technique and I'm excited to see where that goes. Using Scrum on a previous
sememester-long class project turned out to be an immense success to I'm
optimistic that whatever development strategy we decide on will be helpful!

### What's my experience of the class? ###

I'm still having a good time in the class, though it sounds like the material is
beginning to confuse people. Each class Prof. Downing introduces some new Python
concept bundled with some little "gotcha" corollary, and when he quizzes us on
it 5 minutes later the "gotcha" still seems to be giving people trouble.

I'm also noticing a lot of questions that seem to be slowing the class down a
bit. I'm all in favor of people asking questions, clearing up misconceptions and
clarifying edge-cases,
but sometimes I think it might be better for the student to experiment with the
question on their own time and make a piazza note with their conclusion. I'm
just noticing that we've had a few classes where we've been unable to finish the
lecture on time, and I don't like playing catch-up at the beginning of the next
class.

### Tip-of-the-week? ###

Since we will be ramping up into our semester project soon, I thought I'd share
some productivity tools and tips for working with/in teams:

1. **[When2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/)** -
When2meet is a tool that let's
you record everyone's availability for a given period of time so you can find
the best time to meet. I prefer to use it in the days-of-the-week mode so that
I can create weekly schedules with teams. This helps my team avoid having to
constantly play the "when are you available" game whenever they need to schedule
a meeting.

2. **[Slackbot](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202026038-Slackbot-personal-assistant-and-helpful-bot-)** -
For those of you new to Slack, it is an instant messaging
platform geared towards teams, and it sounds like Prof. Downing wants every team
to utilize it. Slackbot is a commandable messaging bot with Slack that you can
control with
little macros. My favorite trick is that you can use `/remind` to send reminders
to people or channels at a certain time. This is useful for recurring team
meetings and project deadlines.

3. **[Slack X Github](https://github.com/integrations/slack)** -
Slack can now
be integrated with github so that when issues are closed or added, an alert is
sent to one of your slack channels.

4. **[Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/)** -
Zenhub integrates a kanban board into
every repository you make
on Github. This kanban board is useful for keeping track of each of the tasks
that your team takes on. You'll always have a grasp of what should be done, what
should be done soon, what is currently being worked on, and what has recently
been completed.

5. **[Github Projects](https://help.github.com/articles/about-projects/)** -
This is the same thing as Zenhub, but it's native to
Github and isn't as full-featured. I prefer Zenhub because there are features
that I need that Github Projects doesn't have yet, but it may still be useful
for your team.

6. **[Lofi Hip Hop Radio](https://youtu.be/9Q0de5Su5w0)** -
I really like
listening to ambient, soft music while I work, and this YouTube livestream
of Lofi Hip Hop really hits that spot. If you've been looking for some new
work-music, give this station a shot!
