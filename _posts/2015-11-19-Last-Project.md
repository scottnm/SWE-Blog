title: Last Project Completed
---

Today, Thursday November 19th, marks the end of the last project in Professor Downing's
Object Oriented Programming class (not the end of the class, but still worth celebrating).
I would like to take this post as an opportunity to reflect on this project.

For starters, this project has been the only project that I ever started late, and
I regretted it whole-heartedly. My start was delayed by a week (due in part to a
lengthy and significant CS354 project), and I realized I was in real trouble when
the design phase of the project had eaten up an entire day and a half of my remaining
week. Conway's Game of Life is a pretty rudimentary Object Oriented programming
exercise, but for some reason this project took me close to 40 hours to complete.

The complexity of generalizing the Game of Life to different types of cells was
more than I expected, and more specifically I stumbled over the hurdle of implementing template
classes in conjuction with designing an inheritance hierarchy. From all of my
recent stack overflow queries it seems that template classes and inheritance
hierarchies do not mesh well together as the virtual keyword and
the dynamic binding fail in the presence of templates. Maybe I don't entirely
understand how templates are optimally designed to be used, but this project felt
a lot like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole by shaving off the edges.

Another bump I ran into when working on this project was not understanding the
guidelines nearly as well as I thought I had. In fact, I was still redesigning
major parts of my code as late as this morning. I'm not sure what I could have done
to improve in this area. I very frequently read and communicated with other
students through piazza. I dedicated a large portion of my time on this project
to the design phase. I didn't start coding blindly or writing untested code. Maybe the lesson to learn
here is that defining the problem isn't something that can be done on the first
pass of the problem and requires many stages of review and reevalution.

### Tip of the Week

As important as it is keep your programming chops sharp, it is important
to take a break and step back. [This article](http://www.developerhandbook.com/career/how-to-avoid-burnout/)
provides a pretty good perspective on the whole situation.
