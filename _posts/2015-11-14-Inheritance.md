title: Inheritance
---

This week marked the start of project 5 and the start of a discussion on inheritance.
I'm surprised it has taken us close to an entire semester in an object oriented
programming class to reach inheritance. On the other hand, this class has been giving
me the impression that extension and inheritance are not particularly desirable features,
so it is possible that Professor Downing only wanted to expose us to inheritance and
not make it seem like a fundamental, must-use feature. The discussion of inheritance
doesn't seem too different from when I was first exposed to it in my introductory
programming course except that now we are discussing how inheritance is implemented
at a high level. As far as the project goes, it definitely has a similar workflow to
the Darwin project. Yesterday alone, I spent upwards of 6-7 hours sketching out designs
and interfaces before even touching any code, and even now that I have, I have only
written a few stub methods and a utility function or two. This project is definitely
giving me practice in trying to design well thought out object oriented systems and
not relying on my ability to clumsily code my way through a problem.

### Tip of the Week

Take time to learn and understand regular expressions (or regex for short).
Even from the cursory level that I have started using them the past month, I have
been incredibly impressed at how useful they have been. Regular expressions in
combination with vim and sed have made my programming substantially more productive.
In class this week, we had a guest speaker from Atlassian who developed a way to
load Gif files quicker in Atlassian's hip chat app which was made entirely possible
through use of regular expressions to do link parsing. Appropriate use of regex
is a skill every developer should have.
