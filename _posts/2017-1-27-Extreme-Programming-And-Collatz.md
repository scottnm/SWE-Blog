### What did you do this past week? ###

This past week was my opportunity to dip my toe into what the rest of the semester would look like.

I started our first project, Collatz, and it is already proving to be a bit challenging. I've implemented the simple solution and a couple of caching optimizations, but I'm struggling to manage the size of the cache.

This week also brought my first minor mistake in the class. Despite my intentions to keep ahead of the reading, I have fallen behind on the chapters assigned out of the Extreme Programming book. After missing a question on Monday's quiz about the readings, I realized I needed to be more serious and have now caught up. The biggest struggle with the readings is that I don't find them particularly interesting, and sometimes I outright disagree with them. I finished reading the chapter with examples on Test-driven-development, and their process of implementing and testing the summarizer module seemed inefficient. They took 40 minutes to write a slightly more complicated set-intersection function and ended up with bloated, scattered code. I support Test-driven-development and Pair-programming, but their example felt poorly executed. I'll keep trucking on with the readings and see if my opinion of this book changes.

### What's in your way? ###

Nothing is in my way right now. I am a little overwhelmed with my part-time job and side projects demanding more of me, but this is happens most semesters. I hasn't kill me before and it won't kill me now.

### What will you do next week? ###

Next week, I will wrap up the Collatz project, and keep on top of the readings. I also plan on asking former SWE students about their final projects so I can better understand what to expect. I hope this will help jump start my own brainstorming.

### What's my experience of the class? ###

So far my experience in the class is pretty positive. The lectures have been entertaining. The piazza discussions have been insightful. I am looking forward to the coming weeks.

### Tip-of-the-week? ###

Do you have any interest in graphics programming, but feel like you don't know where to start? Have you taken a graphics course, but felt like you didn't absorb the material?

I found a [set of lessons](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki) that guide you through implementing a clone of OpenGL without any third-party libraries (especially graphics libraries). I'm not far in the lessons myself, but so far it is very promising! The course reinforces the graphics pipeline in an accessible way with a neat project. This is a great way to learn any CS discipline.
