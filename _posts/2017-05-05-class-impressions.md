title: Class Impressions

I said everything I wanted to say about this class in my previous
[blog post](https://scottnm.github.io/SWE-Blog/Closing-Up/), so this will be a
tidied up version of those thoughts.

This class was great. The lectures were interactive, the projects were fun, and
I got the opportunity to work in a great team. My biggest issue with the
class is that some material felt superfluous.

* XML. We never used XML. The topic doesn’t feel useful enough to dedicate an
entire lecture to. It might be worth talking about when we cover JSON, but no
more than a bullet point.

* Overriding & Overloading Behavior. Most of the overriding and overloading
lesson felt like Java trivia. It may be useful as a case study in an
Object-oriented programming course, but this wasn't that type of course. 

As well, the design patterns lectures need some improvement. It’s important to
expose students to different design patterns, but the lesson needs more helpful
examples. For example, we explored the Visitor Pattern using a Cons/LinkedList
traversal which felt unhelpful. Better examples would show where the patterns
outshine other ways of solving a problem.

To close on something more positive, one of my favorite things about this class
is how much Professor Downing encourages discussion and feedback. In class, I
never felt afraid to ask a question or start a discussion about something he
was teaching. He also incentivizes students to give him feedback through
these blogs, the eCIS forms, and RateMyProfessor. I can tell that Professor
Downing is committed to delivering the best possible class that he can teach.
