title: Minutes before the first class!
---

I am just about to head off to my very first Object Oriented programming lecture.
I have extremely high hopes for this class as OOP principles seem to have remained
a prevalent for many years, and it appears that there is so much more to OOP than
I have learned in my introductory programming classes. I don't know much of what
to expect, but I know I will be using C++ very heavily and I am hoping we will
cover OOP-esque design patterns like the Entity-component pattern.

This class will be a lot of work and I am excited to get started.
