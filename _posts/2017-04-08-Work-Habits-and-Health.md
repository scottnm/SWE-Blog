title: Work Habits and Health

### What did you do this past week? ###

This week we wrapped up phase 2 of the final project. Like a lot of teams, it
seemed that the quicker the deadline approached, the quicker new problems began
to spring up. This was incredibly stressful, and meant that in the last couple
of days, our team was putting in an unhealthy number of hours.
In a real project driven by agile development strategies, It is my understanding
that if the team discovered that their work had revealed itself to be much
harder than originally anticipated than the team would deliver the smallest,
functional form of what they had promised to the customer and re-estimate the
amount of time it would take to complete the entire project. With such a hard
deadline and without a lot of time  (only 10 days), this project felt much less
flexible. When the work got tougher, our team had to work harder, and for some
of us this meant putting in a lot more hours. 

I personally failed to balance my personal health and my work schedule, which
has led me to be sick for the past 4 days. It's almost kind of funny. When I 
went to the doctor's office on Thursday, the doctor noted some common causes of
the cold I was struggling with and I hit every one. Extreme stress? check. Lack
of sleep? check. Poor eating habits? check. Of course, it'd be absurd for me to
blame my sickness entirely on this project. It was probably a fluke of the
season or some allergies run rampant, but my poor health habits only exacerbated
my condition to something worse than it should have been.

In the end, I am extremely proud of my team and all that we accomplished in this
phase. We faced many tough challenges and pushed through them to the end. In the
future though, it must be more of a priority for us to take care of our health
as well.

### What will you do next week? ###

Next week, I'm going to try and put my own advice to use. Of course, I'll still
be working hard since the next phase of the project will come out soon, but I'll
be sure to prioritize my health as well. I plan to make it imperative that I get
a full rest each night, eat better, and exercise regularly.

Here's to hoping the final phase goes smoothly!

### What's my experience of the class? ###

Lecture is fine, but the SQL lectures are starting to get pretty dull. I think it
would be a little more engaging if we had to figure out the SQL commands ourself
with a test database instead of just reading example after example that Professor
Downing has prepared. I'm sure the examples are helpful, it just makes the class
a little dry.

### Tip-of-the-week? ###

[7 Ways to Maintain Work Life Balance](http://curtismchale.ca/2015/08/25/7-ways-to-maintain-work-life-balance/)

So to be perfectly honest, articles like the one I mentioned above are
a dime a dozen at this point. Most of their "hot tips" are really just
common sense, but sometimes we forget our common sense and it can be worthwhile
to remind ourselves what we should already know.

My favorite tip is #7 about planning your work in seasons. A friend at Microsoft
gave me some advice recently that was common sense, but really resonated with me.
He advised that with the kind of work I want to do, there will most likely always
be some form of crunch time. No job can escape deadlines, and you have to meet
those head on. To alleviate that stress, you should plan our your work-life so
that when you aren't in crunch time, you make sure to relax and take a breather.
This doesn't mean that you stop working entirely, but you slow down a bit and
make sure to take time off. As a new software developer, it can be
tempting to always put in 110% to prove yourself,
but an attitude like that often leads to poor mental health and burn out.
