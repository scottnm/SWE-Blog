### What did you do this past week? ###

This past week was pretty rough. Getting going with the IDB project has felt
pretty overwhelming, and more often than not I feel like I have no direction.
Compounded with the limited timeline for this first phase of the project I feel
extra stressed, because I feel like all of the time I'm using to understand 
the project is time that I'm not spending actually doing it.

Despite those difficulties, it's also important to take a step back and acknowledge what I managed to
accomplish. I spent most of my week
getting up to speed with all of the tools that I will need to be an
effective back-end engineer for our team. I spent hours and hours going over
Flask tutorials, the Google Cloud Platform bookshelf tutorial, and SQLAlchemy
tutorials. In retrospect, I'm not sure if all of this tutorial-studying was
as effective as I wanted it to be, but I do feel more capable of building
the website. As well, our team tried to get some of the teamwork/productivity
grunt work out of the way this week: setting up our zenhub board, creating a
teamwide email address, and setting up a collaborative tech report rough draft
page.

One of my prouder achievements this week is that our namecheap domain
[http://www.vennfridge.me](http://www.vennfridge.me) now connects to our Google
App Engine server! Getting this to work was a huge point of frustration for me,
because I know next to nothing about DNS technology and getting web services set
up.

Looking back on the week, it doesn't feel like our team has had an incredibly
strong start, but I'm happy with the work we've put in and what we've managed
to accomplish.

### What will you do next week? ###

Next week is Spring Break and due to the time constrains of the project, it'll
also be the first week for most of our team to really dig into the meat of the 
project. It'll be a challenge to balance work with Spring Break, but I'm optimistic.

### What's my experience of the class? ###

The class is still chugging along, and it sounds like we are about to shift gears
away from lectures over Python. I enjoyed Professor Downing's Python lectures,
but I'm excited to learn something that isn't strictly Python.

### Tip-of-the-week? ###

Here are some tools and resources that my team has gathered this week that we
are hoping will help us with the project:

#### [flask cheatsheet](https://scottnm.github.io/SWE-Blog/files/flask-cheatsheet.pdf)
This cheatsheet is useful just to have as a quick reference sheet for anyone
working on their backend.

#### [flask blueprints simple explanation](https://youtu.be/K5LBC3hLl8w)
Flask blueprints seem like a good way to separate logic between your website
and the api we will have to expose.

#### [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
Typescript adds a powerful static type system for javascript.

#### [javascript strict mode](http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/)
Javascript strict mode seems like a useful feature to keep frontend devs from
falling into any obscure JS pitfalls

#### [showdown js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)
This is a tool to convert markdown to html. I think this could be useful so that
you don't have to monkey around with html whenever you update the technical 
report on your website. By writing the report in markdown and translating to
html, you can keep your report nicely formatted and maintainable.


#### [Healing - In Love With a Ghost](https://inlovewithaghost.bandcamp.com/album/healing)
Do you like ambient music inspired by VGM & Chiptunes? Lord knows that I do. I
just stumbled upon this album two days ago, and its been super pleasant to work
to
