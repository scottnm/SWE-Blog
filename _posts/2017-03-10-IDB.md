### What did you do this past week? ###

This past week was pretty rough. Starting the IDB project was pretty
overwhelming, and more often than not I felt lost.
The limited timeline for this assignment stresses me out; Anytime
I spend working to understand the project feels like time I'm losing.

On a positive note, I was able to work through a wide variety of tutorials, and
now feel capable to dive into the project. The official Flask tutorial and the
App Engine Bookshelf tutorial were particularly helpful.

As well, our team got some of the productivity grunt work out of the way this
week. We setup our Zenhub board, created a teamwide email address, and setup a
collaborative technical report document. 


One of my prouder achievements this week was connecting our
[Namecheap domain](http://www.vennfridge.me) to our Google App Engine server.
Setting this up was frustrating because I know very little about web-service
technologies. I'm excited to finally see it up and running.

In retrospect, our team didn't have an amazing start, but Im happy with our work
and what weve managed to do.

### What will you do next week? ###

Next week is Spring Break and the first week that our team can dig into the meat
of the project. Itll be a challenge to balance work with Spring Break, but I'm
optimistic.

### What's my experience of the class? ###

The class is still chugging along, and it sounds like we are about to shift
gears away from lectures over Python. I enjoyed Professor Downings Python
lectures, but I'm excited to learn something that new.

### Tip-of-the-week? ###

Here are some resources that my team gathered to help us with this project:

#### [flask cheatsheet](https://scottnm.github.io/SWE-Blog/files/flask-cheatsheet.pdf)
This cheat-sheet is a useful, quick reference for anyone working with the
back-end.

#### [flask blueprints simple explanation](https://youtu.be/K5LBC3hLl8w)
Flask blueprints seem like a good way to separate logic between your website
and the API we will be exposing.

#### [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
Typescript adds a powerful static type system for javascript.

#### [javascript strict mode](http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/)
Javascript's "strict mode" will prevent front-end developers from falling into
obscure Javascript pitfalls.

#### [showdown js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)
This is a tool to convert markdown to html, and it will be helpful for the
technical report. By writing the report in markdown, our team can maintain it
without having worry about maintaining the formatting.


#### [Healing - In Love With a Ghost](https://inlovewithaghost.bandcamp.com/album/healing)
Do you like ambient music inspired by VGM & Chiptunes? Lord knows that I do. I
stumbled upon this album two days ago, and its been super pleasant to work
to.
