title: Pen and Paper Programming
---

Aside from this week's test, not much happened in class (which means this post will be 90% tip of the week).
The test was just a tad more difficult than I was expecting, but I felt prepared enough to at least attempt all of the questions.
Project 3 has just been posted and now that I've exhausted my supply of friends in the class, I will have
to start reaching out to more classmates to find a partner. At the very least it will all be interesting. 

# Tip of the Week

**TL;DR: DON'T FORGET TO PRACTICE PEN AND PAPER PROGRAMMING**

My past week was consumed by two activities: studying for my first Object Oriented Programming test and preparing for my internship interview on Friday. 
Each of these activities while not directly linked did share one common thread between them, pen and paper programming. For those unfamiliar with the
term, it just refers to writing code on plain old paper without the help of a text editor, IDE, or compiler (to catch compile time errors).
Pen and Paper Programming at the very worst should be nothing worse than an inconvenience, but I discovered that my ability to write good code without
the help of autocomplete,  linters, and compile time errors has seriously degraded over the past year. I find myself often making painfully stupid
mistakes: leaving out semicolons, misspelling common STL methods, and using dot-notation when I need arrow-notation for pointers along with other silly syntax errors. While no 
programmer should be ashamed that their development environment makes them more efficient, I do feel very self conscious that these tools
have become a crutch for me. Some would make the argument that in today's world of Google searches, compiler warnings, and stack overflow questions
those minor mistakes are insignificant, but considering the large number of programming bugs that were essentially syntax errors that the compiler
didn't or couldn't catch, I'd have to disagree. 

With a better grasp of pen and paper programming, I would have left my Object Oriented Programming test
more confidently and I surely would feel more prepared for my upcoming interviews. The boost in efficiency from avoiding compiler error messages
alone is enough to convince me I need to practice more and be more mindful of my code.
