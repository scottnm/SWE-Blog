title: Massive Tests and Tiny Renderers
---

### What did you do this past week? ###

My focus for this week was split between 3 major activities: Studying for
test #1, brainstorming for project #3, and putting time into the
[tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki)
project that I posted about
[earlier in the semester.](https://scottnm.github.io/SWE-Blog/Extreme-Programming-And-Collatz/)

**Studying**

Success on the tests in this class is incredibly important because there's only
two tests in the semester and they are weighted quite heavily. Students who do
poorly on the first test usually drop the class because of how difficult it can
be to recover. With this in mind I wanted to make it a priority that I actively
review the ongoing study discussions on piazza and revisit any material that I
hadn't covered in awhile (the XP and database readings in particular). All in
all, I felt pretty confident with how much I studied. I implemented example
classes to prepare for the tougher programming problems, I made notes over the
database readings to not get tripped up by any of that terminology, and I made
a couple of different study sheets that I could pick from depending on what I
felt more or less confident about when the test date finally came. I came out
of the test barely missing the A mark, and although I'm frustrated by that grade,
I felt the test was fair and that my studying paid off.

**Project 3 Prep** 

This week my group brainstormed ideas for project 3,
and a couple of the ideas feel like winners. The
most difficult part has been finding the supporting RESTful APIs that we need to
use, but just this morning our group find some promising resources. As well,
the team seems to be meshing quite nicely, and everyone seems to have gotten
used to using Slack as our messaging platform.

**Tinyrenderer**

I have finally started making some real progress with the
[tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki) project and I couldn't
be more excited. I'm only a couple of sections into the project, but even with
that I've gotten to touch on drawing lines, drawing triangles, rasterizing
triangles, z-buffering, barycentric coordinates, and texture mapping, and the
output of the project is looking really sweet!

I can say with confidence that if you are interested in working through this
project, you should definitely give yourself a couple of hours to dig into it!
It's a lot of fun.

### What will you do next week? ###

Next week will be all about getting up to speed with Project 3: finalizing our
idea, deciding on high level design and architecture, and breaking down our
next milestone into smaller tasks that our team can tackle.

### What's my experience of the class? ###

The class is going well. Despite my disappointment in my test grade, I feel
confident that I can still do very well in this class and I'm excited to see
how this final set of projects will turn out. Self-driven group projects always
have the coolest results.

### Tip-of-the-week? ###

Whether professionally or as a hobbyist, I see myself as a video game developer,
and as we learn about Test-driven Development, I'm curious to learn how video
game devs view TDD strategies.

Here are some articles that I found interesting over TDD in game development:
