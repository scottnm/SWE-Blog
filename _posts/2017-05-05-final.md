title: Class Impressions

I pretty much said everything I wanted to say about this class in my previous
[blog post](https://scottnm.github.io/SWE-Blog/Closing-Up/), so this post will
just be a tidied up version of those thoughts.

This class was great. The lectures were interactive, the projects were fun,
and I got the opportunity to work in a really great team atmosphere. My biggest
issue with the class is that there was some material
that should be cut to make room for more interesting material. Here are some
of the topics that I felt were unnecessary.

* XML: We never used XML. The software engineering world barely seems to use XML.
 The topic just doesn't feel useful enough to dedicate an entire lecture to. It
 might be worth talking about when we cover JSON, but no more than a bullet point.

* Overriding & Overloading Behavior: Object-oriented programming is an important
 practice to understand given how prevalent it is in the software engineering
 world. That being said, this class isn't about object-oriented programming.
 Most of the overriding & overloading lecture material feels more like
 Java trivia than anything that will help us solve problems better.

As well, the design patterns lectures need some improvement. I think it's
important to expose students to different design patterns, but I think it should
be done with more helpful examples. For example, the Visitor Pattern was
shown to us using a Cons/LinkedList traversal which was unnecessary.
I think it's helpful to show examples where the patterns clearly outshine other
ways of solving a problem.

To close on something more positive, one of my favorite things about this class
is how much Professor Downing encourages discussion and feedback. In class, I
never felt afraid to ask a question or start a discussion about something he was
teaching. He also incentivizes students to give him feedback through these blogs,
the eCIS forms, and RateMyProfessor. It definitely feels like Professor Downing
is committed to delivering the best possible class that he can teach.
